a) I've used AES with CBC mode. As we are talking about a secure messaging algorithm, I've decided to go with a symmetrical key as latency does matter in the matters of communication.(And more explained in part c) After deciding to use a symmetrical ciphering algorithm, AES with a strong key value made the most sense. For the mode, I've picked CBC as again a matter of good security. While CBC can be slow when encrypting/decrypting large files due to the sequential nature of it, this should not be a concern as this will be used to exchange confidential messages, rather than large files.
b) I'm using 256 bits. Since we are talking about writing a secure/confidential messaging program, the assumption is while latency does matter, making the system more secure is worth to make the service slightly less fast. While 128 bit AES would be a good choice as well, 256 bits would be a safer bet against quantum computer attacks, which is becoming more a reality by each year.
